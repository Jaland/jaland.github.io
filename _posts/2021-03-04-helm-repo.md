## Create the Git Repository

Here you can either create a new repository and add your own helm charts, or you can fork [this](https://github.com/Jaland/application-helm-chart) repository.

## Set up the the Helm Repository

Check out a new branch: `git checkout -b gh-pages-2`

Package our charts using the `helm package` command. If using the example github page then then the following commands will work:
```
helm package example-chart-1
helm package example-chart-2
```

Create the `index.yaml` file that will be used to server our charts with the command `helm repo index .`

Push our changes
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Releasing helm repository"
git push
```

## Serve our Helm Repo

Inside the Github Web UI navigate to `Settings`

Under the `GitHub Pages` section choose the `gh-pages-2` branch, and click "Save"

You should see the message "Your site is ready to be published at <URL>"

## Test Our New Repository

Add our newly created repo to our list of helm repos: `helm repo add example-repo https://jland-redhat.github.io/helm-repo-example/`

And finally validate we can actually view our charts with `helm search repo example-repo`:

Should see something similar to the following:

```
NAME                              	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
example-repo/example_application-1	1.0.0        	1.17.0     	A Helm chart for Kubernetes
example-repo/example_application-2	1.0.0        	1.17.0     	A Helm chart for Kubernetes
```
