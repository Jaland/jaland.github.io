# Board Game List 2022

Last year I created a [top 100 list of board games](https://jaland.github.io/fun/2022/02/02/top-100-boardgames.html) and it was a lot of fun, so I decided to do it again this year. I used the same method as last year and this year and I even tracked the movement of games between this year and last year.

# The Results

Color Scale:

* <span style="color:DarkRed">Dark Red</span> <= -25 spots
* <span style="color:DeepPink">Red</span> <= -12 spots
* <span style="color:GoldenRod">Yellow</span> > -12 spots $$ < 12
* <span style="color:Green">Green</span> >= 12 spots
* <span style="color:DarkGreen">Dark Green</span> >= 25 spots

## Final Thoughts

Looking at the list I wanted to break down some thoughts on why things changed and general trends for me this year.

### Items that went Up (Green)

Looking at the green items on the list I am noticing three themes.

The first and most prominent one is an increase in games that are easy to get to the table with my non-gamer friends. While I love a complex games more and more of the people I play with do not have the patiences to spend time learning rules so games like `Just One` and `Downforce` are games I can get to the table, set up quickly, and teach quickly (especially `Just One`)

The second theme of games taking major jumps are games my wife enjoys playing. While we don't play every weekend she has become my major gaming partner, so anything I can trick her into playing with me is a major plus on my list, and `Lost Cities` got a huge bump for that. She is also obsessed with `Unicorn Fever` which is why that one is so high as well.

And the final theme where is less pronounced I think are a couple heavier games that have grown on my over time. I think Dune (I know only +6 but I made it green since it was already so high), Cthulhu Wars, and Dwellings of Eldervale are games that I initially enjoyed but the more I think back on my playtime with them, the more fond my memories are. Cthulhu Wars in particular is one I want to get back too and try out again.

#### Biggest Riser

I am going to mention three games for my biggest risers that increased over 50 spots, all of which have been mentioned before

**Unicorn Fever + 60 Spots**: This is just a game that my wife is obsessed with. Honestly I think the part where you are grabbing your bid chips drags a little bit, and setup is not quite as fast as I would like for a game that is this light. But while I think there are better games out there where you can bet on races this is the only that makes her the happiest, which is why I enjoy it so much.

**Lost Cities + 68 Spots**: Super quick setup, plays pretty fast, lots of very interesting decisions, and most importantly my wife loves it. I can fit it in my backpack or pocket for when we visit breweries which is addition plus, but this game is so much fun!

**Down Force + 55** I really enjoy both the bidding and racing stages in this game. It is a big hit with most of my friends, and fairly easy to explain/setup which is a major plus. I think the thing about this game that really made it rise through the ranks is that it is non-party game that I can bring out with people who do not play a lot of boardgames without having them fall asleep or zone out during the rules.

### Items that went Down (Red)

The only major Theme I see in a lot of the games that have had major drops on my list is play time, and especially setup time. Things like Gloomhaven/Mage Knight/Thunderstone Quest just take so long to setup that I don't ever see myself bringing them out. Honestly at this point in my life there are just too many really great games with shorter setup times. I am not even sure many of these games would hit the table even if I was with my more "gamer" friends

That being said I have started doing some solo gaming and enjoyed my first playthrough of Mage Knight solo, so I will be interested to see where it lands next year.

#### Biggest Faller

**Thunderstone Quest - 53** I just recently received this game when I made this list last year so I think the super high ranking was based on a handful of plays. I still think this is one of my favorite deck building games I just wish it was more geared toward the "ultimate" variant. Having to find and pick out a set of cards to use can make setup a lot longer than I would like

**The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth -51** I want to like this game so much... but I can not find a group that will stay with me past the first game in the campaign. Maybe this is another one I will play solo and it will shoot back up the list but I am so sick of that first scenario that I can not rank it higher than this.
