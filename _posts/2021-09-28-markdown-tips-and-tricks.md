# Intro

Not going to go into "how to use" mark down in general in this section. Just going to make notes of things I find useful/forget how to do.


## Links

To link to a specific section such as the one below, inside of your markdown file it can be down using `[link](title-to-link-too)`: [example](title-to-link-too)

### Title to link too   


## Style

*File*:
I like to style a code snippet that is contained in a specific file I like to use `#### **\`File Name\`**` directly above the snippet, I think it generally looks nice

#### **`example.yaml`**
```
key: value
type: file
```
