# The Method

For this post I thought it would be nice to do something fun. I found out about a new website called [Pub Meeple](https://rankingengine.pubmeeple.com/) that helps with ranking of anything (although it is targeted at boardgames). The basic methodology of how this site works is by adding all of the games you think will make the top 100 (I choose to add almost every game in my bgg "collection" meaning any game I rated or marked as owned). And it would take two games pit them against one another and ask you "Which of these do you like more?"

Honestly it took a while but I had a good time and I think I am happy with the results of the list so maybe I will start doing this yearly.
